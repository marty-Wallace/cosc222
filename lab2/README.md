Lab 1: Problem Statement 

Student numbers are composed of nine digits. Examples are 300123456 and 300456231. Write a program in C++ that wil read student numbers from a text file, one number per line, until the end of the file is reached. The program will then examine the student numbers to determine the number of digits required (from the right) so that the numbers are still unique. The program simply displays this result. This program should run in n space where n is the number of student ids in the file. 

You are to hand in a printout of a documented version of your program with a Big O analysis of the algorithm. 

Write another documented and analysed program that solves the problem, but the n space restriction is relaxed.
